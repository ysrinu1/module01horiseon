## Description

The Horiseon website follows Search Engine Optimization and Accessibility standards.

This repo was an exercise to practice refactoring code for accessibility, such as adding `alt` text for images, and semantic `html` tags.

Along side this, we were tasked to refactor the code for efficiency, readability, and sustainability, as well as ensure all functionality worked as intended.
